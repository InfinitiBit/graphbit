Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computer systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of algorithms that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

The core concept behind machine learning is to build algorithms that can receive input data and use statistical analysis to predict an output while updating outputs as new data becomes available.

Types of Machine Learning:
1. Supervised Learning - Learning from labeled data
2. Unsupervised Learning - Finding patterns in unlabeled data
3. Reinforcement Learning - Learning through trial and error

Applications include image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles.
