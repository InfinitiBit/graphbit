Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers understand, interpret, and manipulate human language. It combines computational linguistics with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models.

Key NLP tasks include:
- Text Classification: Categorizing text into predefined groups
- Named Entity Recognition: Identifying and classifying named entities
- Sentiment Analysis: Determining the emotional tone of text
- Machine Translation: Translating text from one language to another
- Question Answering: Providing answers to questions posed in natural language

Modern NLP systems use transformer architectures like BERT and GPT, which have achieved remarkable performance on various language understanding tasks.
