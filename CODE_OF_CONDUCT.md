# GraphBit Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as contributors, maintainers, and community members pledge to make participation in the GraphBit community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community and the project
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Helping newcomers get started (as encouraged in `docs/development/contributing.md`)

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, discrimination, or hate speech in any form
- Personal attacks, insults, trolling, or deliberately inflammatory comments
- Sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Doxxing or publishing others’ private information without explicit permission
- Intimidation, stalking, or sustained disruption of discussions
- Threats of violence, incitement of violence, or encouragement of self-harm
- Deliberate misuse of reporting channels (e.g., false or bad-faith reports)

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

For GraphBit, enforcement is handled by the project maintainers and/or designated representatives of **InfinitiBit GmbH**.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces for GraphBit, including (but not limited to):

- GitHub repositories (issues, pull requests, code reviews, discussions)
- Documentation contributions
- Community chat spaces (e.g., Discord, if/when used)
- Official project communication channels

It also applies when an individual is officially representing the project or InfinitiBit GmbH in public spaces.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it.

**Preferred reporting channel (confidential):**

- Email: **info@graphbit.ai**
- Suggested subject line: **“Code of Conduct Report”**

Please include as much of the following as you can:

- A description of what happened and where it occurred
- When it occurred (timestamps/timezone if possible)
- Links, screenshots, logs, or other supporting context
- Names/handles of those involved and any witnesses
- Your preferred way to be contacted and whether you want your report kept anonymous to the extent possible

We will treat reports as confidential to the extent possible and will not tolerate retaliation against reporters or those participating in an investigation.

## Enforcement Process

Upon receiving a report, maintainers/designated InfinitiBit representatives will:

1. Acknowledge receipt (typically within a few business days)
2. Review and investigate the report, requesting additional context if needed
3. Decide on an appropriate response consistent with this policy
4. Communicate the outcome to the reporter (when possible and appropriate)

## Enforcement Guidelines

The following community impact guidelines are used to determine the consequences for violations:

1. **Correction**: A private (or public, when appropriate) clarification of expectations.
2. **Warning**: A formal warning with consequences for continued behavior.
3. **Temporary Ban**: Temporary removal from community interaction (e.g., GitHub discussions/issues/PRs) for a specified period.
4. **Permanent Ban**: Permanent removal from project community spaces.

Maintainers may also take additional actions where appropriate, including editing or removing comments/content, locking conversations, reverting changes, or escalating to GitHub’s moderation/reporting mechanisms.

## Consequences

Violations of this Code of Conduct may result in any action deemed necessary to protect the community and the project, including warnings, temporary suspension, or permanent bans from participation.
