# About GraphBit

GraphBit is a proprietary, production‑first LLM framework engineered for real‑world, agentic AI orchestration. It is designed to outperform and outlast prototypes, delivering measurable gains under enterprise workloads.

GraphBit delivers exceptional efficiency at scale, with up to 10× improvements in CPU usage, latency, and reliability compared to conventional frameworks. Its production-grade execution capabilities include robust concurrency handling, comprehensive observability, and built-in fault tolerance designed for 24/7 operational systems.

Many AI frameworks falter in production—agents crash under load, silent failures go undetected, and debugging becomes guesswork. GraphBit bridges the gap from proof‑of‑concept to production with a resilient execution layer that remains stable under pressure.
