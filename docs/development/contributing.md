## Development Workflow

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub
2. **Create** a feature branch from `main`
3. **Make** your changes following our coding standards
4. **Test** your changes thoroughly
5. **Submit** a pull request

### Code Quality

We maintain high code quality standards:

- **Rust**: `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo test`
- **Python**: `black`, `isort`, `flake8`, `mypy`, `pytest`
- **Pre-commit**: Automated quality checks on every commit

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test categories
cargo test --workspace          # Rust tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v     # Python tests
make integration-test           # Integration tests
```

## Architecture Overview

GraphBit uses a three-tier architecture:

- **Python API**: PyO3 bindings with async support
- **CLI Tool**: Project management and execution
- **Rust Core**: Workflow engine, agents, LLM providers

Key components:
- **Workflow Engine**: Graph execution and dependency management
- **Agent System**: AI-powered processing components
- **LLM Providers**: Multi-provider abstraction (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **Type System**: Strong typing with comprehensive validation

## Coding Standards

### Rust Code
- Follow `rustfmt` formatting
- Use `clippy` for linting
- Write comprehensive documentation
- Include unit tests for new functionality

### Python Code
- Follow PEP 8 with 200-character line length
- Use type hints for all public APIs
- Write docstrings for classes and functions
- Include type checking with `mypy`

### Documentation
- Write clear, concise documentation
- Include code examples
- Keep examples up-to-date
- Use consistent formatting

## Performance Considerations

When contributing code:
- Consider memory allocation patterns
- Use async/await for I/O operations
- Implement proper error handling
- Add benchmarks for performance-critical code

## Security Guidelines

- Never commit API keys or secrets
- Validate all inputs
- Use secure communication (HTTPS/TLS)
- Follow secure coding practices

## Community Guidelines

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Help newcomers get started
- Share knowledge and expertise
- Follow our code of conduct
