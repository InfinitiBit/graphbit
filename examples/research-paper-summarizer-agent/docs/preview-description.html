  A powerful research paper analysis and Q&amp;A system built with the <strong>GraphBit framework</strong>.
  This application automatically extracts, summarizes, and enables intelligent questioning of research papers
  using advanced AI capabilities. Upload PDF research papers to receive section-wise summaries (Abstract,
  Introduction, Methods, Results, etc.) and ask natural language questions about the content. The system
  leverages GraphBit's native document processing with PDF text extraction, intelligent text splitting,
  FAISS-based semantic search, and smart caching for faster re-processing of previously analyzed papers.
