Deep Learning and Neural Networks

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks) to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input.

Neural networks are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks in animal brains. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers:
- Input Layer: Receives the initial data
- Hidden Layers: Process and transform the data
- Output Layer: Produces the final result

Deep learning has revolutionized fields such as computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language understanding. Popular architectures include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image processing and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequential data.
