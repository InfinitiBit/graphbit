Computer Vision and Image Recognition

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world. Using digital images from cameras and videos and deep learning models, machines can accurately identify and classify objects.

Key applications include:
- Object Detection: Identifying and locating objects in images
- Facial Recognition: Identifying individuals based on facial features
- Image Segmentation: Dividing images into meaningful regions
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR): Converting images of text into machine-readable text

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the backbone of most modern computer vision systems, enabling breakthrough performance in image classification and object detection tasks.
